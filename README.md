# PageNorth WHMCS Admin Area Theme

This is a custom WHMCS Theme designed for PageNorth ltd. It allows us to have a tailored experience without modifying the software's source code.

## Notes

* The main pagenorth css customisations are stored in /css/pn-styles.css, But due to caching, they're also included in the header.tpl for instant results while working on them.

* The customisations for the admin login screen are stored in 0_login, and should be copied to the parent of the theme directory to work.
